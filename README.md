# Quality_Anomaly_Detection
 The goal of this project is Determination of defects through chromate process result values ‚Äã‚Äãand image data.
 This is a process of applying a rust-preventive film using dichromate, which is used for high-end products that require gloss.
If the concentration of the solution is low, the result of the white chromate process does not appear, and if the concentration of the solution is high, the galvanized thickness is reduced by more than 1ùúáùëö
Due to environmental regulations, the reaction product must be less than hexavalent chromium.
The dissolution and precipitation reactions involved in the process are not simple in their reaction structure and pathway, so it is important to create an appropriate reaction environment and conditions.

There are two types of data: image and numerical data.
I created each model based on both types of data.
As a result, The best model's accuracy(on test data) is 100.0%
